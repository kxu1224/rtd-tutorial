Example Datasets
=====

We utilized miRNA-seq and RNA-seq datasets from four TCGA studies: Breast Invasive Carcinoma
(BRCA), Prostate Adenocarcinoma (PRAD), Skin Cutaneous Melanoma (SKCM), and Acute Myeloid
Leukemia (LAML).

The example datasets provided in the package can be used for a few examples. 
SKCMPositive_4 can be used for a pilot experiment, as shown in :ref:`_pilot`.


Using three examples of pilot experiment for VAE with loss ratio 1-10 on dataset SKCMPositive_4, case study for WGAN-GP on dataset BRCASubtype and transfer learning for MAF from PRAD dataset to BRCA, we demonstrate how to execute 'SyNG-BTS'.
