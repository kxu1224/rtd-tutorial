Example Datasets
=====

We utilized miRNA-seq and RNA-seq datasets from four TCGA studies: Breast Invasive Carcinoma
(BRCA), Prostate Adenocarcinoma (PRAD), Skin Cutaneous Melanoma (SKCM), and Acute Myeloid
Leukemia (LAML).

The example datasets provided in the package can be used for a few examples. 
SKCMPositive_4 can be used for a pilot experiment using VAE with loss ratio 1-10, as shown in :ref:`<pilot>`.
A case study can be done on the dataset BRCASubtype using WGAN-GP.
Transfer learning as an example can be done using MAF from PRAD dataset to BRCA
