Welcome to SyNG-BTS documentation!
===================================

**SyNG-BTS** SyNG-BTS is a data augmentation tool synthesizing transcriptomics data with realistic distributions without relying on a predefined formula. Three deep generative models are considered, incluing Variational Auto Encoder (VAE), Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), and flow-based generative model. Those models will be trained on a pilot dataset and then utilized to generate data for any desired number of samples.

More information can be found in this `Github repository <https://github.com/LXQin/SyNG-BTS/tree/main>`_.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
